# Pycord

Super simple Discord API layer. Like, if you want something full-featured, this isn't it. Try [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

This library is suitable for simple bots that allow users to send commands. No voice support at all.

2. Setup virtual environment: `virtualenv env -p python3.6`
